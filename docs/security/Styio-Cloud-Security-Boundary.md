# Platform Security Boundary

**Purpose:** Define the initial trust split for hosted compile and registry control-plane services.

## Boundary

`styio-cloud` treats local `pafio` manifests and lockfiles as client
inputs. It validates execution lanes, risk classes, source revisions, and
registry write requests before dispatching work to hosted workers or server
control planes.

Compiler-private execution remains behind `styio`; package-manager credential
storage remains in `pafio` until a platform credential service is designed.

## V1 Service Trust Rules

The first cloud service kernel requires mTLS for operator access,
regional-node links, worker-internal lifecycle calls, and internal service
callers. Public client auth can evolve separately, but service-to-service
traffic may not rely on bearer-only trust inside the platform boundary.

Postgres is the durable control-plane state boundary. Provider-neutral object
storage, with S3 first, stores artifacts and replayable objects; database rows
must keep object references, digests, lifecycle state, and audit metadata.
